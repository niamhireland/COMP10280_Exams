#TASK

#The 2023â€“2024 academic year for a particular Australian university runs from 1 March 2023 to the end of February the 
#following year. Write a program that prompts the user for a series of days (integer numbers) and, for each day, prints 
#out the date, the monthand the year in the 2023â€“2024 academic year of that day. The program should continue
#until a non-positive number is entered.

#PSEUDOCODE 

#ask user to input a number 
#set functions to identify the date, year and date, using if statements 
#while the user input is greater than 0 and less than 366: 
    #print out results 
    #ask for repeat input 

#else terminate the program
